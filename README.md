# WP Presi

A simple theme that turns your website into a presentation. 

The homepage will be a slideshow where you can use your left/right keys to navigate slides. 

Once you go to an actual post, you can navigate with the arrow keys to move between posts. 

## This is in BETA

This was used for my WordCamp Atlanta 2015 presentation (entitled Hacking WordPress: Making WP Work For You). I loaded it up without doing a clean sweep, so there will definitely be some errors. ;)
